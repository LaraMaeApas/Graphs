# Graphs

# Introduction:
The Campus Map Navigation application uses a graph data structure to represent university buildings and pathways. Buildings are represented as nodes, and pathways are edges,
enabling users to navigate the campus efficiently.

# Features:
•	Add buildings to the campus map.
•	Define pathways between buildings.
•	Find the shortest route between two buildings using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

# Why this application was created
This application was created to help students and visitors navigate a university campus efficiently by finding the shortest path between buildings. It demonstrates how graph theory solves real-world problems while providing a practical tool for campus navigation.

# How it contributes
Time-saving: Helps users, whether students or visitors, find the quickest routes between buildings, improving overall efficiency.
Learning Tool: Demonstrates graph theory and algorithms like BFS, benefiting anyone learning about data structures.
Enhanced Accessibility: Makes it easier for new users (students, staff, or visitors) to navigate complex environments, improving overall campus experience.
